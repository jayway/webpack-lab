# Getting started with Webpack 3!
Webpack is a highly configurable module bundler that also transpiles code with loaders and plugins.

In this lab you will get started with the basics of webpack 3 and maybe have time to learn some more advanced concepts as well.

## Quick start

1. Install nodejs and npm if you haven't already
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Run npm install in this folder

Now you're ready to rumble!

## Exercises

We will transpile react and postcss code in this lab. But webpack isn't limited to that, it can transpile angular, vuejs, sass, less etc as well.

I recommend that you do the exercises in order, but it isn't necessary since they are independent of each other.

### Basic

1. [transpile-react](./transpile-react)
1. [transpile-postcss](./transpile-postcss)
1. [watching](./watching)
