# Resolvers

Webpack has some resolvers that makes our life a lot easier when importing modules. You can probably manage without proper resolving in a small project, but the bigger it gets the more important it is.

I have made the folder structure in this exercise look a bit more like a real project in order to show the point with resolvers.

In the root folder we now have the folders server (made up node server) and shared. Shared contains constants and validators that is used both in the node server and the react app.
